Golf is indeed the fastest-growing game 
on an international level.
A life long game for 
every golf addict
In the United States alone there are
over twenty-five millions golfers,
playing over 15,000 courses. 
Once considered the game of the wealthy,
golf is changing its image. 
Exclusive clubs are 
no longer the mode of the day, 
as architects are building
courses for the public.
